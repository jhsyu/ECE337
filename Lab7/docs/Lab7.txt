Q7.2.1
compared with the original image, the filtered image lost some details, for example, the lightness of the lightings decreases, and the people has only a vague shape. this is reasonable, since the filter does not allow all the frequency bands go through the filter. only specific frequency bands can pass it. therefore, the content that falls in the reject band was discarded during the processing. 

Q7.2.2
open a file: 	file = $fopen(filename, "rb"); // rb is the operation permission level.

write a file: 	$fwrite(file, "%c", source); // "" is the format or write. 
size of a file: $ftell(file);
move the pointer: $fseek(file, ptr, pos);
close the file: $fclose(file);
